# GameMaker GML Code Samples
Free gamemaker gml code for the boys

If you're here, you're probably an absolute barnacle at GML, and need some guidance code to help you.
Do not fear, little one, for I have just the thing for you.

This github repository contains my own code, with comments for each section to help you break it down.
I don't expect you to have the external code (e.g. macros, functions) at hand either,
so I list them at the top of each script, along with other side notes to go with the code.

Each script is split into **3 sections**:
- Notes/Resources
- Variable Definitions
- Code

The *Notes* section has already been explained above. <br>
The *Variable Definitions* section contains the variables defined in... well... the *Variable Definitions* window. <br>
Each variable also contains a comment alongside it that **states the type of the variable**. Additionally, if the variable has a range for it, **the comment will show the range**. <br>
It should be noted that you are **not required** to put these variables in the *Variable Definitions* window. You can copy and paste them into the *Create* event, and the code will still work. The *only downside* to this is that it is less convenient to change these variables, as you have to keep going to the *Create* event to change them, or type them out manually instead of using a slider or drop-down menu.

Finally, the *Code* section will contain the main code, split into each event in the object. <br>
Most of the time, **your code will not work out-of-the-box.** You will most likely have to replace a comment in a function with your own assets. For example, if the script had to take a font, *you would be required to input your own font*, where a nested comment lies.
